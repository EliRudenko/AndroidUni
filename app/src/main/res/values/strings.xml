        <item>I made another mistake, thought I could change\nThought I could make it out\nPromises break, need to hear you say\nYou&apos;re gonna keep it now\nI miss the way you say my name\nThe way you bend, the way you break\nYour makeup running down your face\nThe way you touch, the way you taste</item>
        <item>When the curtains call the time\nWill we both go home alive?\nIt wasn&apos;t hard to realize\nLove&apos;s the death of peace of mind</item>
        <item>You&apos;re in the walls that I made with crosses and frames\nHanging upside down\nFor granted, in vain, I took everything\nI ever cared about\nI miss the way you say my name\nThe way you bend, the way you break\nYour makeup running down your face\nThe way you fuck, the way you taste</item>
        <item>When the curtains call the time\nWill we both be satisfied?\nIt wasn&apos;t hard to realize\nLove&apos;s the death of peace of mind\nWhen the curtains call the time\nWill we both go home alive?\nIt wasn&apos;t hard to realize\nLove&apos;s the death of peace of mind</item>
        <item>You come and go in waves\nLeaving me in your wake\nYou come and go in waves\nSwallowing everything\nAre you satisfied?\nLove&apos;s the death of peace of mind</item>
        <item>Mind, mind\nWhen the curtains call the time\nWill we both go home alive?\nIt wasn&apos;t hard to realize\nLove&apos;s the death of peace of mind\nWhen the curtains call the time\nWill we both be satisfied?\nIt wasn&apos;t hard to realize\nLove&apos;s the death of peace of mind</item>
